# Celluloid::Pmap

Parallel Mapping using Celluloid

Celluloid Futures are wicked sweet, and when combined with a #pmap
implementation AND a supervisor to keep the max threads down, you can be wicked
sweet too!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'celluloid-pmap'

## Usage

Default usage will execute in parallel. Simply pass a block to an Enumerable
(like an Array)

```
[55,65,75,85].pmap{|speed_limit| puts "I can't drive __#{speed_limit}";
sleep(rand)}
```

Problem: When using with ActiveRecord, you can quickly run out of connections. 
Answer: Specify the max number of threads (actors) to create at once!

```
puts "You should see two distinct groups of timestamps, 3 seconds apart"
(1..20).pmap(10){|speed_limit| puts Time.now; sleep(3)}
```
